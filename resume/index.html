  <p>I am a digital journalist with a passion for spotlighting stories important to racial and ethnic minorities in the US.</p>

  <h2>Experience:</h2>

  <h3>Investigative Reporter</h3>
  <h4>The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism</h4>
  <h5>June 2020 - Present</h5>
  <p>I used remote reporting techniques with a team of 20+ journalists to determine how the covid-19 emergency is impacting evictions and homelessness in cities across the US. Our summer story, "Confusion over eviction ban led to selective enforcement," was featured by news outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today.</p>

  <h3>Founder and Curator</h3>
  <h4>Worker Bee Stories: workerbeestories.com</h4>
  <h5>Aril 2020 - Present</h5>
  <p>I leveraged my experiences as a food server to create this unique project in community storytelling. I designed the website using Wix.com. I recruited and worked with 10 writers to develop their ideas into published stories, and I promoted Worker Bee Stories across Facebook and Instagram.</p>

  <h3>Script Writer</h3>
  <h4>Think Bangla</h4>
  <h5>Feb 2020 - Present</h5>
  <p>I developed scripts for YouTube videos that are educational, entertaining and culturally relevant for Bangla-speaking people. I wrote the script for the channel's most-watched video (English translation: "How India Crashed Into Asia and Changed the World"), resulting in over 118 thousand views on YouTube.</p>

  <h3>Digital Production Assistant</h3>
  <h4>CNN</h4>
  <h5>Aug 2019 - Feb 2020</h5>
  <p>I pitched, produced, edited and published 60+ videos, generating over 30 million views to CNN.com. I also led CNN Live Streams for the closely-watched impeachment hearings into President Trump. As an intern in the months before, I wrote 50+ articles in trending stories, human interest and news recaps for CNN.com.</p>
