Questions

1.  In the sentence below, put in the necessary code that would allow users to click on the word Google and open Google's homepage in a new browser:

<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> is the best search engine in the world.


2.  Describe the purpose of a DIV tag.

A DIV tag sorts your HTML code into different sections or divisions (which is why it's called a "div" tag). This can help you style specific divisions differently in CSS i.e. apply a red border to all the content in one div tag, a blue fill to all the content in another div tag, etc.


3.  Write out the basic structure of an HTML page, putting the basic tags in the correct position.  (Note: you don't need to connect it to a stylesheet or include DIV tags or anything like that).

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>


4.  There are two main "areas" or "sections" in the basic structure of an HTML page. In which area would you put a link to a stylesheet?

You would put a link to a stylesheet in the "head" section. In my midterm review assignment, I inserted a link to my stylesheet right under the "title" area (which is also in the "head" section).


5.  In which main "area" or "section" of an HTML page would you put text, images or DIV tags?

Text, images and DIV tags go in the "body" section of an HTML page.


6.  In the space below, put one DIV tag with a class of graphicbox and a second DIV tag with an ID of name.

<div class="graphicbox"></div>
<div id="name"></div>


7.  In the space below, put one DIV tag with an ID of apples and a class of fruit.

<div id="apples" class="fruit"></div>


8.  In the space below, write the correct CSS code to target a DIV with a class of fruit.  Make the color of the text black (#000000).

.fruit {
  color: #000000
}

If we wanted the CSS code to target a DIV with an ID of apples and a class of fruit, the code would be:

#apples.fruit {
  color: red;
}


9.  What tag would we use to include an image on an HTML page? Just give me the name of the tag, you don't have to write out all the code.

We use the <img> tag. Here's an example from my midterm review assignment: <img src="images\banner.png" alt="Coronavirus Daily masthead">


10.  Why do we use media queries?

We  use media queries for responsive web design -- to make sure our design still looks good across various screen sizes (i.e. desktop vs. mobile).


11. What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?

A serif font has a little stroke at the end of each larger stroke in a letter, whereas a sans-serif font does not have the little strokes. Serif fonts tend to look more formal (and old), whereas sans-serif fonts tend to look more modern (and clean).


12. Which of the following is a hexadecimal code?
#FFCC33
123,543,242
101010101
-213

#FFCC33 is a hexadecimal code. It's a shade of yellow!
